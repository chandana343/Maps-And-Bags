              If you thought Goa was all about beaches, churches or forts, think again. The eastern and southern borders of the state with Karnataka are dotted with wildlife sanctuaries (WLS) and national parks. Running parallel to Indian Ocean, the Western Ghats or Sahyadri mountain range makes for one big corridor crisscrossing Goa that preserves and showcases the best of flora and fauna. Its unique ecosystem makes it a natural home for big cats like tigers, panthers or leopards, for bisons, venomous snakes like king cobra, winged creatures like kites or eagles and langurs and more.
