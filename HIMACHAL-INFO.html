            Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose was won over by the beauty of Dalhousie, a famous tourist destination in Himachal Pradesh, so much so, that he stayed here for many months in 1937. 
            Today, he has two places named after him - Subhash Baoli and Subhash Chowk.
            The hill station has the same effect on tourists today, with its waterfalls, rivers making their way through mountains, dense forest trails that run parallel to enormous cliffs with grand views of Dauladhar range in the distance and a couple of churches that were built during the British Raj. 
            Cafes, markest, Mall Road, those are equally convincing reasons to plan a trip to Dalhousie.

                The temple of Brijeshwari is located in the town of Nagarkot, Kangra district, Himachal Pradesh, India and is 11 km away from the nearest railway station of Kangra.
                The Kangra Fort is situated nearby.A legend says that after Goddess Sati sacrificed herself in the honor of Lord Shiva in her Fathers Yagya.
                Shiva took her body on his shoulder and started Tandav. In order to stop him from destroying the world Lord Vishnu divided the body of Sati into 51 parts with his Chakra. 
                The left breast of Sati fell at this spot, thus making it a Shakti Peeth.
                The original temple was built by the Pandavas at the time of Mahabharatha.
