            A city of contrasts, Hyderabad exudes an old-world charm of its own with the Old City (Charminar side), Hitech City (Cyberabad) and the other areas lying between the old and the new. The capital and the largest city of Telanaga, Hyderabad is home to stately mosques and noisy bazaars lined parallelly alongside swanky new office buildings and malls, and it is these very contrasts – these glimpses into the city’s rich past with inherent promises of an even better future –that make Hyderabad a city worth visiting. Maybe even more than once.

              Situated in the Western part of the beautiful city of Hyderabad at a distance of approximately 9 km from Hussain Sagar Lake, Golconda Fort is one of the region's best-preserved monuments. The construction of this fort was completed in the 1600s and it is reputed for being the area where once, the mighty Koh-I-Noor diamond was stored. It is said that if you clap your hands at the bottom of the fort, the echoes of it can be heard right to the top! The architecture, the legends, the history, and the mystery of Golconda Fort add to its allure and make it one of the must-visit places in Hyderabad.

                The Birla Mandir in Hyderabad forms a pleasant serene atmosphere and is a perfect place for those who wish to get away from city life and immerse themselves in prayer and meditation. The Mandir is dedicated to the Lord Venkateshwara of Tirumala and is in fact modelled after and is the replica of the idol of Balaji of Tirupati.

Created in 1976 by Swami Renganathananda from Ramakrishna Ashram and constructed by the Birla Foundation, the Birla Mandir has been a safe haven for all those looking for a few hours of peace amongst the glorious landscape.
