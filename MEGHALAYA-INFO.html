            Founded in the second half of the nineteenth century by the British, Shillong town has enjoyed a cosmopolitan core since its beginnings. 
            This reflects in the unique culture of Meghalaya’s scenic capital – a place where every festival is celebrated with zest and travellers will stumble across cuisines from across the country and the world.
            Shillong’s modern reputation is built on its love for music and there have been many legendary musicians who call this home. 
            There are many faces to Shillong – the quiet neighbourhoods with whistling pine still thrive but there is also a vibrant downtown area. 
            Shillong is also known for its emerging café culture.
            Attractions here include the pleasant, tree-lined Ward’s Lake and the sprawling Golf Links – a favourite outdoor recreational space for the residents.

              Khasi Hills, physiographic region, central Meghalaya state, northeastern India.
               The area consists mostly of hilly regions and includes the Shillong Plateau; it is drained by tributaries of the Brahmaputra and Surma rivers. 
               The Cherrapunji scarp in the south has one of the highest average annual rainfalls in the world. 
              The Khasi Hills region is sometimes called the “Scotland of the East” because of its scenic beauty.

                Natural bridges weaved from the giant roots of trees that last for generations, root bridges showcase the harmony that the Khasi tribe has with nature.
                The descent to the Nongriat double-decker root bridge is an epic one. You begin at the tip of the valley close to the village of Tyrna and climb down approximately 3000 steps. 
                On the way, there are plenty of stunning vistas and natural sights to soak in.
                The root bridges of Meghalaya are an enigma, an integral part of the old Khasi lifestyle that dates back to the times when trekking through thick forests and negotiating fast-flowing rivers was a part of the routine.

                  Balpakram, ‘the land of perpetual winds’, may not be well-known to the outside world but it is an important part of Garo folklore. 
                  Its unchartered jungles, massive cliffs, and powerful rivers have birthed many stories of the paranormal type, including that of the stalking ‘mandeburung’, or man of the jungle, straight out of the cryptozoologist’s handbook. 
                  If these tales don’t inspire you to tread through its forest paths, Balpakram National Park is also a treasure trove of animal and plant life, including the endangered wild water buffalo. 
                  Designated as the land of the spirits by local lore, a Balpakram experience blends the natural with the mystical.
