            Literally “Lake of Mustard”, Tam Dil is situated near Saitual Village, about 87.5 km from Aizawl. Having been developed as an important pisciculture centre by the Fisheries Department and a holiday resort by the Tourism Department, this is one of the most frequented lakes in the state. The lake and the surrounding thick forest are home to wide species of trees, plants and animals.

According to folklore, a couple used to have a jhum cultivation in this small valley surrounded by hills, but the man died suddenly and left the woman to look after the crops alone.

                  Located at a distance of about 137kms from Aizawl, Vantawng khawhthla or Vantawng Fall is the highest and most spectacular of all the waterfalls and cascades in the fast flowing rivers of Mizoram. It is located in Vanva river near Thenzawl and is named after Vantawnga who was said to be an excellent swimmer. So good a swimmer was Vantawnga that he could hover in the cascading water like a fish, but unfortunately during one of such performances, a drifting log fell from above and killed him.
