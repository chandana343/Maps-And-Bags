                Baidyanath Jyotirlinga temple, also commonly referred to as the Baidyanath Dham, is one of the twelve Jyotirlinga in India and is considered to be the most sacred abodes of Lord Shiva.
                The importance of Baidyanath Jyotirlinga is that the main temple is beyond historical dates. Devotees from the age of Ram, the king of Ayodhya, come to see it. 
                The top has three ascending shaped gold vessels set compactly, which were donated by the Maharaja of Gidhaur, Raja Puran Singh.
