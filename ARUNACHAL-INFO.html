              Also known as Jung/Jang Falls or Bong Bong Falls, Nuranang Falls drops down from an altitude of 100 meters. 
              It originates from northern slopes of the famous Sela Pass, furth Nuranang River forms the waterfalls and then it plunges into Tawang River.
              It is located hardly 2 kilometers from Jang nearby the road that connects Tawang and Bomdila.
              And that's perhaps the reason why it is known as Jang waterfalls. 
              <h5>FUN FACT</h5><br>
              <span style="text-align: right;">Nuranang river and Nuranang falls are named after a local Monpa girl named Nura who helped the Rifleman Jaswant Singh Rawat, a Maha Vir Chakra awardee soldier during the 1962 Sino-Indian War but was later captured by Chinese forces.</span>
