              Kanyakumari is a small coastal town in Tamil Nadu, famous for its mountainous terrain, palm-fringed beaches, coconut-lined paddy fields, and iconic monuments. 
              Earlier it was known as 'Cape Comorin' or 'The Land's End'. Kanyakumari is a paradise for nature lovers, history buffs, and peace seekers as it is home to some of the most beautiful waterfalls and ancient temples.
              The unique thing about Kanyakumari is that it is the only place in India where you can see the sunrise and sunset on the same beach. And on full moon days, you can witness the sunset and moonrise simultaneously.
