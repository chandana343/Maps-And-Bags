    <h1>Karnataka</h1>
    <h2>Hampi</h2>
    <center><a target="_blank" href="https://www.holidify.com/images/bgImages/HAMPI.jpg">
        <img src="https://www.holidify.com/images/bgImages/HAMPI.jpg" alt="Forest">
      </a></center>
    <p>Hampi, the city of ruins, is a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Situated in the shadowed depth of hills and valleys in the state of Karnataka, this place is a historical delight for travellers. Surrounded by 500 ancient monuments, beautiful temples, bustling street markets, bastions, treasury building and captivating remains of Vijayanagar Empire, Hampi is a backpacker's delight. Hampi is an open museum with 100+ locations to explore and a favourite way to see the city from the perspective of its history.


        Hampi was the capital of the Vijayanagar empire around 1500 AD, and by some accounts, the second largest city in the world at that time. Over the next centuries it fell out of importance, and now you can explore the ruins of a lot of temples and other structures spread out over a vast area.</p>
        <h2>Coorg</h2>
        <center><a target="_blank" href="https://www.holidify.com/images/bgImages/COORG.jpg">
            <img src="https://www.holidify.com/images/bgImages/COORG.jpg" alt="Forest">
          </a></center>
        <p>Located amidst imposing mountains in Karnataka with a perpetually misty landscape, Coorg is a popular coffee producing hill station. It is popular for its beautiful green hills and the streams cutting right through them. It also stands as a popular destination because of its culture and people. The Kodavas, a local clan specializing in martial arts, are especially notable for their keen hospitality.

            Coorg, officially known as Kodagu, is the most affluent hill station in Karnataka. It is well known for its breathtakingly exotic scenery and lush greenery. Forest covered hills, spice and coffee plantations only add to the landscape.</p>
    <h2>Gokarna</h2>
    <center><a target="_blank" href="https://www.holidify.com/images/bgImages/GOKARNA.jpg">
        <img src="https://www.holidify.com/images/bgImages/GOKARNA.jpg" alt="Forest">
      </a></center>
    <p>With its pristine beaches and breathtaking landscapes, Gokarna is a Hindu pilgrimage town in Karnataka and a newly found hub for beach lovers and hippies. Situated on the coast of Karwar, every year Gokarna welcomes hordes of tourists from around the world in search of sanctity and relaxation. The out-of-town beaches like Kudle beach and Om Beach are a different contrast to life inside the town. 

        Palm clad beaches are dotted with foreign tourists in a majority and very few Indians are seen across. Gokarna is not very conventionally touristy. The beaches are meant for a slow, relaxed holiday and everything on the beach goes at the same relaxed pace. Full of coconut and palm trees, the ocean and clean sands, Gokarna is a 'one of a kind' place in the country.</p>
        <h2>Mysore</h2>
    <center><a target="_blank" href="https://www.holidify.com/images/bgImages/MYSORE.jpg">
        <img src="https://www.holidify.com/images/bgImages/MYSORE.jpg" alt="Forest">
      </a></center>
    <p>Famously known as The City of Palaces, it wouldnâ€™t be wrong to say that Mysore, currently Mysuru, is one of the most important places in the country regarding ancient reigns. It is replete with the history of its dazzling royal heritage, intricate architecture, its famed silk sarees, yoga, and sandalwood, to name just a few. Located in the foothills of the Chamundi Hills, Mysore is the third most populated city in Karnataka, and its rich heritage draws millions of tourists all year round. The highlight is the majestic Mysore Palace, a UNESCO World Heritage Site, which is a must-visit.

        Mysore was one of the three largest Princely States in the erstwhile British Empire of India. To this day, the Mysore Palace stands tall as one of the most spectacular palaces in India.</p>
        <h2>Murudeshwar</h2>
    <center><a target="_blank" href="https://www.holidify.com/images/bgImages/MURUDESHWAR.jpg">
        <img src="https://www.holidify.com/images/bgImages/MURUDESHWAR.jpg" alt="Forest">
      </a></center>
    <p>Murudeshwar is home to the second tallest statue of Lord Shiva (123 ft) in the world. With the shimmering Arabian Sea on three sides and the magnificent Western Ghats imposing their presence on this town, it is a favourite picnic spot for the folks from Kerala and Karnataka. The beaches and the adventure activities around Netrani island are significant attractions for the tourists.

        Murudeshwar temple and fort are also the most visited spots, captivating one with their rustic charm and beauty. Nearby Netrani island is also a trendy spot for tourists as it offers excellent snorkelling and scuba diving opportunities. The Murudeshwar beach, however, has become a little overcrowded and dirty due to human intervention and could be avoided.</p>
        <h2>Bangalore</h2>
    <center><a target="_blank" href="https://www.holidify.com/images/bgImages/BANGALORE.jpg">
        <img src="https://www.holidify.com/images/bgImages/BANGALORE.jpg" alt="Forest">
      </a></center>
    <p>Having evolved gradually from being the Garden city to the Silicon Valley of India, Bangalore is India's third-largest city. Bangalore is loved for its pleasant weather, beautiful parks and the many lakes here. Bangalore is renowned for its eateries, street food corners, quirky cafes, coffee roasters and pubs dotting every corner of the city, serving cuisines from all over the world. Brunches, buffets, burgers, rooftop cafes, late-night eats - Bangalore has it all.

        Here, one can choose to take a long stroll through the beautiful Cubbon Park, shop in the many malls or street markets or hop into one of the many acclaimed breweries for a cold and refreshing drink. There are a huge number of beautifully decorated parks in the city that are ideal for going on a morning stroll or a jog. One walk through the 300-acre Cubbon Park, or the botanical gardens of Lalbagh, and you'll know precisely why Bangalore is so famously called India's 'Garden City'.</p>
        <h1 style="text-decoration: underline;">All you need is the plan, the road map, and the courage to press on to your destination.</h1>
